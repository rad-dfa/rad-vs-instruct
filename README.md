# A Comparative Study of RAD Embeddings and Natural Language Instruction Embeddings

This repo contains code for comparing [RAD Embeddings](https://github.com/rad-dfa/rad-embeddings) and natural language instruction embeddings in Automata-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL). To sample automata and language instructions from the same task class, we use precomputed automata–instruction pair datasets generated by our [dfa2instruct](https://github.com/rad-dfa/dfa2instruct) framework. See `rad_vs_instruct/datasets/` for the considered datasets and see `rad_vs_instruct/train.py` and `rad_vs_instruct/test.py` for train and test scripts, respectively.
